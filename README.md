# üçä nectarine-clock 
*Nectarines are more gentle and fresh than tomatos.*

This timer based on the pomodoro method will not only help you stay on top of your work but will also encourage you to take good care of your health in the meantime!

## Why?
When focusing on a task we often forget to take care about our bodies. But in the long run it's so important for our health and productivity! <br>
The goal is to make taking care of your body an easier job so you can focus on the work and we take care of *the rest*.
